Enhanced Security with Additional Firewalls: To bolster the security of the infrastructure, three supplementary firewalls have been incorporated. These firewalls act as a protective barrier between the external network (Internet) and the internal servers. They meticulously filter and regulate incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. By doing so, they fortify the web infrastructure against unauthorized access, malicious attacks, and potential vulnerabilities.

SSL Certificate and HTTPS Implementation: The configuration of the load balancer involves SSL termination, which entails decrypting HTTPS traffic from users and forwarding it as unencrypted HTTP to the servers. To ensure the website's security, an SSL certificate is installed, allowing the traffic to be served over HTTPS. This encryption protocol safeguards the communication between the user's browser and the web server, guaranteeing confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of transmitted data over the network.

Data Collectors for Monitoring: The deployment of three monitoring clients facilitates data collection and transmission to a monitoring service like Sumo Logic. These monitoring clients are responsible for aggregating metrics, logs, and performance data from the servers, web servers, and application components. They provide valuable insights into the overall health, performance, and availability of the web infrastructure, enabling proactive identification and resolution of potential issues.

Purpose of Monitoring: The primary objective of monitoring is to monitor, analyze, and evaluate the performance, availability, and health of the web infrastructure. It serves as a means to identify and address potential problems such as elevated response times, errors, resource utilization, and network issues. By engaging in continuous monitoring, proactive maintenance, troubleshooting, and optimization measures can be implemented to ensure an optimal user experience while minimizing downtime.

Data Collection via Monitoring Tool: The monitoring tool collects relevant data by installing agents or clients on the servers. These agents gather metrics, logs, and performance data, which are then transmitted to the monitoring service for real-time analysis and visualization or at regular intervals. This data collection process facilitates ongoing monitoring and enables prompt detection of any anomalies or deviations from expected performance.

Monitoring Web Server QPS: Monitoring the web server's QPS (Queries Per Second) involves collecting metrics related to incoming HTTP requests, tracking the number of requests per second, and analyzing long-term trends. By establishing appropriate monitoring thresholds, alerts can be triggered when the QPS surpasses predefined limits. This proactive approach allows for timely scaling or optimization measures to be implemented.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Potential Vulnerability in SSL Termination: SSL termination at the load balancer level can introduce security concerns if the communication between the load balancer and the application servers is not adequately secured. Transmitting traffic between the load balancer and the application servers as plain HTTP leaves it vulnerable to eavesdropping or unauthorized access. To ensure end-to-end security, it is advisable to encrypt the communication between the load balancer and the application servers.

Single MySQL Server as a Write Destination: Relying on a single MySQL server capable of accepting write operations creates a single point of failure. In the event of primary node failure, write operations cannot be performed until the primary node is restored. This can result in service disruptions and potential data loss. Implementing a highly available database setup, such as multi-master or master-master replication, can mitigate this issue.

Identical Components on All Servers: Employing servers with identical components (database, web server, and application server) can lead to challenges concerning scalability, performance, and maintenance. For instance, if the application server or database server becomes a bottleneck, it affects all servers since they are configured identically. Introducing distinct server roles, such as separating database servers from application servers, provides more flexibility in terms of scaling, optimizing performance, and efficient resource management.
