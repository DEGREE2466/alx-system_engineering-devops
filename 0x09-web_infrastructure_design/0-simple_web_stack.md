Explanation of the Infrastructure:

Server: Within this context, the server denotes a singular physical or virtual machine that houses all the essential components of the web infrastructure. It encompasses the web server, application server, and database server.

Domain Name: The domain name "foobar.com" acts as the exclusive identifier for the website. Users can employ this domain name to access the website instead of inputting the server's IP address. This domain name provides a more user-friendly and memorable means of reaching the website.

DNS Record for "www" in www.foobar.com: Typically, the DNS record for the "www" subdomain in www.foobar.com is configured as a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. This CNAME record points to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8), signifying that requests for www.foobar.com should be directed to that IP.

Web Server (Nginx): The web server, Nginx in this instance, plays a pivotal role in handling incoming HTTP requests from users. It listens on port 80, receiving requests for the website. Moreover, the web server can perform tasks such as SSL/TLS encryption, load balancing, caching, and serving static files.

Application Server: The application server undertakes the execution of the server-side code within the web application. It executes the application's logic, processes user requests, and generates dynamic content to transmit back to the user's browser. It functions as an intermediary between the web server and the application code, overseeing business logic, data retrieval, and interaction with the database.

Database (MySQL): The MySQL database server is accountable for storing and managing the website's data. It persistently retains information like user data, content, and other pertinent data for the application. The application server communicates with the database server to retrieve and manipulate data as necessary.

Server-User Communication: The server engages in communication with the user's computer via the internet employing the HTTP protocol. When a user requests the website, their computer dispatches an HTTP request to the server. The server processes the request, retrieves the requisite resources from the application and database servers, and forwards an HTTP response back to the user's computer, providing the requested content.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): This infrastructure encompasses a solitary server, implying that if the server encounters failure, the entire website becomes inaccessible. Hardware failure, network issues, or software crashes could result in prolonged downtime until the server is reinstated.

Downtime During Maintenance: Conducting maintenance tasks, such as deploying new code or restarting the web server, causes website downtime. During these maintenance activities, users are unable to access the site.

Limited Scalability: The infrastructure lacks the capability to handle a significant increase in incoming traffic. If there is an abrupt surge in user requests, the lone server may become overwhelmed, leading to degraded performance or complete unavailability. To effectively manage high traffic loads, additional servers or load balancers would be necessary.

To mitigate these concerns, a more resilient infrastructure could involve the implementation of a distributed system.
